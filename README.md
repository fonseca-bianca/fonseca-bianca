<h1 align="left">Hello, World!👋👩🏻‍💻✨ </h1>

<p align="left">My name is Bianca and I'm from Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. 🇧🇷
  
I'm starting my journey in the world of programming and I'm very excited about the possibilities this field offers. 

I have a particular interest in Back-End, Machine Learning and AI and I'm looking for opportunities to develop my skills and contribute to interesting projects.

I believe that programming is a powerful tool for solving complex problems and I'm eager to use this tool to make a difference.

I'm always learning and looking for ways to improve. If you have any interesting project or opportunity, I'd love to hear more!

Thank you for visiting my profile. 😊</p>
