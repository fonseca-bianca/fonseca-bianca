I'm starting my journey in the world of programming and I'm very excited about the possibilities this field offers. 

I have a particular interest in Back-End, Machine Learning anda AI and I'm looking for opportunities to develop my skills and contribute to interesting projects.

I believe that programming is a powerful tool for solving complex problems and I'm eager to use this tool to make a difference.

I'm always learning and looking for ways to improve. If you have any interesting project or opportunity, I'd love to hear more!
